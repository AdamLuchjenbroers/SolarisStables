         "description":"The pilot skill counts as having a level 3 variable range targeting system. During the end phase, the pilot may switch between three different targeting modes. Once initiative is determined the player is stuck with whatever mode he had at end of last round. Choice is written on sheet but changes are declared, but not which of the three modes is chosen. Normal mode is the standard unmodified shots at short range, two harder at medium, and four at long. Short range shifts short range to -1 easier, at the penalty that long range becomes 5 harder. Long range reverses that, with short range becoming 1 harder, while long is only 3 harder."
